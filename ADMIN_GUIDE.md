# MentorMod — Admin Guide (MVP)

MentorMod moderates your Discord server by guiding users to fix violations before enforcing rules.

## 1. Add MentorMod
- Open the MentorMod invite link
- Select your server
- Click **Authorize**
(You must have **Manage Server** permission)

## 2. Check permissions
MentorMod requires:
- Read & send messages
- Manage messages
- Create & reply in threads
- Add reactions
- Read message history

## 3. Run setup (required)
In any server channel, run:
/setup  
Admins only.

## 4. Choose a template
Select the ruleset that best fits your community.

## 5. Choose how violations are handled

### flag (recommended)
Warn first & guide users to fix messages; deletes if violation persists.  
This approach helps reduce repeat violations by resolving issues early, typically lowering moderator workload while keeping enforcement consistent.

### delete
Immediate removal of violating messages.  
Violations are removed right away, without a warning-first flow.

## 6. Finish
You’ll receive a private confirmation showing the selected template and enforcement mode.  
Run `/setup` anytime to change settings.
