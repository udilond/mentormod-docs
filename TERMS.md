Last updated: January 2026

By inviting or using the MentorMod Discord bot, you agree to these Terms of Service.
If you do not agree, do not use MentorMod.

## 1. Description of the Service

MentorMod is an AI powered moderation bot for Discord servers. It evaluates messages for rule violations, applies moderation actions, and assists server administrators and moderators in enforcing server rules consistently.
MentorMod acts only within servers where it has been explicitly invited and configured by a server administrator.

## 2. Eligibility and Audience

MentorMod is intended for general audiences, including minors.
Server administrators are responsible for ensuring that the use of MentorMod complies with applicable laws and platform rules in their jurisdiction.

## 3. Server Administrator Responsibility

MentorMod operates based on configuration choices made by server administrators.
Administrators are responsible for:
- Informing their community about the use of moderation bots
- Defining and enforcing server rules
- Configuring MentorMod appropriately using available setup options

MentorMod does not replace human moderation judgment.

## 4. Moderation Actions

MentorMod may perform the following actions depending on configuration and detected violations:
- Delete messages automatically
- Create threads related to moderation events
- Send direct messages to users
- Temporarily suspend users for repeated or unattended violations

These actions are automated and may occasionally result in false positives or errors.

## 5. Data Processing and Logging

When a message is evaluated and determined to violate rules, MentorMod logs:
- Full message content
- Message ID
- User ID
- Server ID

These logs are used for moderation enforcement, diagnostics, and service improvement.

## 6. Data Retention

At this stage, moderation logs are retained indefinitely.
Retention limits may be introduced in future versions.

## 7. Third Party AI Services

Message content is sent to a third party AI service for rule violation evaluation.
MentorMod does not control how these services process or retain data. Their use is governed by the terms and privacy policies of the respective providers.

## 8. Feedback

Users may submit feedback using the /feedback command.
Feedback is reviewed by the MentorMod team for improvement purposes only and does not affect moderation decisions.

## 9. Monetization

MentorMod is currently free to use.
Future versions may introduce paid plans or features. Any such changes will be communicated in advance.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

MentorMod is provided on an as is basis.
The service owner is not liable for moderation decisions, message deletions, user suspensions, or any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the service.
